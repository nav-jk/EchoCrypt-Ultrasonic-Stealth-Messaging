# EchoCrypt: Ultrasonic Stealth Messaging

 **Real-time audio steganography using ultrasonic frequencies (17-19 kHz) to transmit messages between laptops!**  

##  Overview  
EchoCrypt is a cutting-edge project that enables **real-time, inaudible communication** between laptops using sound waves. It leverages **M-FSK (Multiple Frequency Shift Keying) with Hamming error correction** to encode, transmit, and decode messages in the **17-19 kHz range**, making it imperceptible to human ears but detectable by laptop microphones.

##  Features  
 **Inaudible Transmission** – Uses 17-19 kHz for communication  
 **FSK Modulation** – Converts text into frequency shifts  
 **Hamming(7,4) Error Correction** – Ensures reliable transmission  
 **Real-time Signal Processing** – Transmit and receive instantly  
 **Cross-platform Compatibility** – Works on most modern laptops  

##  Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **NumPy** – Signal processing  
- **SciPy** – Frequency modulation  
- **PyDub** – Audio handling  
- **Sounddevice** – Real-time recording & playback  

##  Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nav-jk/EchoCrypt-Ultrasonic-Stealth-Messaging.git
